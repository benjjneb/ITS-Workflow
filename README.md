# ITS-Workflow

This Github repository maintains the tutorial walks through of version 1.8 of the DADA2 pipeline on a small multi-sample ITS amplicon dataset. 

The dataset used here is a Mock ITS community constructed by selecting a 23 known fungal cultures from the Center for Forest Mycology Research (CFMR) culture collection and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using a 2 X 300 bp sequencing kit.
